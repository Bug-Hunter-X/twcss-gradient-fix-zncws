```javascript
/* Ensure your Tailwind configuration is correct and includes the gradient plugin.  Check your `tailwind.config.js` (or `tailwind.config.cjs`) file.  It should include:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        // ... other custom colors
      }
    }
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/forms'), // or any other plugins you may have
    require('tailwindcss'),
  ],
};
```

Next, make sure you have correctly imported the CSS file (tailwind.css or similar) into your main CSS file or index.html.

Check for typos in the class names and ensure you are using the correct syntax and color values. You might also need to adjust the color values to ensure they are valid Tailwind color names.
